           <div class="list"> <h3>1. It stays lighter longer </h3><img src="1.gif" width="30%"><p>Sometimes in the winter it can feel like the sun barely makes an appearance <br>for more than four hours a day. One of the best parts of summer is that it doesn’t get dark until around 8:30 or 9pm, which means more time for fun outside.</p> 
           
            <div class="list"> <h3>2.Picnics and picnic food </h3><img src="2.gif" width="30%"><p>Warm comfort foods have a place in our hearts, but summer is the only time we have a real excuse to indulge <br>in hot dogs, hamburgers, potato salad and other yummy picnic staples without apology, plus getting together with friends and family for outdoor fun is definitely a plus.</p> 
               
                <div class="list"> <h3>3. Summer fruits </h3><img src="3.gif" width="40%"><p>Sure, apples are delicious, but everyone knows that summer is the season <br>for all the best fruits. Peaches, strawberries, blueberries, watermelon and many others are all at their peak and ready for eating.</p> 
                   
                    <div class="list"> <h3>4. The pool </h3><img src="4.jpg" width="40%"><p>It doesn’t matter if you have one in your backyard or make the trek to your<br> local pool, summer hasn’t arrived until the kids (and you) have taken that first dip!</p> 
                        
                        <div class="list"> <h3>5. Warm weather </h3><img src="4.gif" width="40%"><p>The most obvious reason summer is the best season is warm weather! There's nothing<br> we love more than breaking out those beloved shorts, T-shirts and dresses so our skin can see the light of day.</p> 
                           
                            <div class="list"> <h3>6. Ice cream </h3><img src="6.gif" width="40%"><p>Whether you're Ben & Jerry's loyal or go for a 20p ice-pole from your local <br>newsagents, there's nothing like an icy treat when it's actually decent outside.</p> 
                               
                                <div class="list"> <h3>7. Going to the beach </h3><img src="7.gif" width="50%"><p>Sometimes in the winter it can feel like the sun barely makes an appearance <br>for more than four hours a day. One of the best parts of summer is that it doesn’t get dark until around 8:30 or 9pm, which means more time for fun outside.</p> 
                                   
                                    <div class="list"> <h3>8. Exercising </h3><img src="8.gif" width="50%"><p>Is it just us, or is going for a run, playing football in the park<br> or doing a few games of rounders just better during summer</p> 
                                       
                                        <div class="list"> <h3>9. Summer songs </h3><img src="9.gif" width="50%"><p>As well as movies, all of our favourite artists bring out some proper <br>anthems that pair best with sitting in the sun sipping a cool drink!</p> 
                                           
                                            <div class="list"> <h3>10. The summer playlist  </h3><img src="10.webp" width="60%"><p>The summer playlist i just made for you it should be the best reason why you should love summer more than winter </p>
